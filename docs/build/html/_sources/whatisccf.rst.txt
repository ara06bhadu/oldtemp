What is CCF?
============

CCF stands for Common Components Framework. so it is basically a framework  that we can use across multiple clients for their requirements satisfaction.

Okay, so let us take an example, that there is a client, the one which      expect that you have the raw data available out there.

And they expect us to process that data basically clean that data transform that data and load the data and show that data and our dashboard or with the help of a tool or any web application.
